Since the inception of Web3, we have achieved numerous milestones. One of these accomplishments is IPFS-based decentralised storage. Although IPFS is fantastic, the disadvantage emerges when users must utilise it on a daily basis. IPFS is based on a content-based addressing mechanism, which returns a lengthy string when files are uploaded to IPFS. This string changes whenever the file's content on IPFS is updated. This isn't practical for daily use because keeping track of the CIDs is a time-consuming task.

## And there comes Trug !

A decentralized file storage platform which functions quite similar to Google Drive with static URLs and enchanced Web3 features. On Trug, you can set up access controls which as facilitated by contracts deployed on the Wallaby Testnet powered by Filecoin. You can enable Sybil protection on a number of public files using Polygon ID.
